                  This is what FRESH-FRUITY, a startup born in the midst of the
                  pandemic, is doing with its online-to-offline model of
                  distributing fruits and .
                </p>
                <p>
                  FRESH-FRUITY is the creation of eGreen Farms, a food retail
                  company based in Delhi that was established in 2018. Indra
                , the company's founder, began developing
                  FRESH-FRUITY well before the pandemic began. However, due to
                  the COVID-19 outbreak, its introduction was pushed back. The
                  platform was finally launched in January 2021.

                  What Problems does FRESH-FRUITY Solve?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Essentially, FRESH-FRUITY provides a future-ready experience
                  for purchasing farm-fresh Fruits and , in which customers can
                  book a grocery cart on the app (similar to booking a cab),
                  wait for it to arrive at their door, and handpick the best
                  stock themselves.
                  <br />
                  FRESH-FRUITY employs specialized supply logistics to deliver
                  exclusive carts containing a variety of Fruits and at the
                  customer's defined time slot. The carts are organized by
                  localities/sectors.

        <h4 className="text-success">Indra, the company's founder, says:</h4>
        <p>
          "Demand varies according to location. Fruit and vegetable sales could
          be demographically aligned to Bengal if a customer is staying at CR
          Park [in Delhi]. Similarly, those things may be of little value in a
          place like Rohini, which is inhabited by people from Haryana and Uttar
          Pradesh."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Unlike other online grocery platforms that require consumers to
          pre-order products and have them shipped, FRESH-FRUITY allows
          customers to touch, sound, and handpick the fruits and at the time of
          purchase."
        </p>
        <p>
          "They do just what they will do in a typical mandi, but from the
          comfort of their own homes. 'We're keeping the old thela tradition
          alive, but in a new package,' Indra says."
        </p>
        <h5 className="text-success">He Goes on to clarify the need for such a service, saying:</h5>
        <p>
          "During the pandemic, people were accustomed to purchasing fruits and
          online. However, the issue with online grocery is that you are limited
          to what they offer. Often the packaging is incorrect, and other times
          the consistency is subpar. When a cart arrives at your door, you can
          pick from the stock and do not have to depend on what is delivered."
